On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

  First, the last sentiment analysis is always returning "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'" instead of printing the score.
  Second, please make the program user-friendly. The program is printing out all the information without a label so the user doesn't know what it is printing. Formatting the tweets into a nice UI would make the user understand the purpose of the program easier.
