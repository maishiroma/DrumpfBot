# DrumpfBot
Class Project for CPSC 353, where we make a Twitter Bot that retweets popular tweets from popular topics.

## Description
Our project will be to create a Twitter program using the basis of the Sentiment Analysis project we made earlier and add on more features. We are planning to make a “Twitter Bot” (a Twitter user that is controlled by a computer rather than a person) that will analyze the sentiment stream every 20 minutes. After every analysis, it will determine which hashtag is the most liked out of all of the tweets it found. Once it finds the most positive post with said popular hashtag and retweet it.

## Concepts used in class
-	Connecting to a server and searching its database.
-	Using Github
-	Understanding the Sentiment Analysis project
-	Creating an Application that will “hide” the underlining layers of the network layers.

## Goal for next submission
- Create Twitter account that will host the program retweets.
- Create part of program that will periodically retweet tweets.
